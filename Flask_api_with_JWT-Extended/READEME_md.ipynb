        "#**Flask-jwt-extended Section**\n",
        "This section presents the basic usage of an active flask JWT extension called flask-jwt-extended. We inherited and simplified the project structure from section 6 to demonstrate how to apply flask-jwt-extended to our project.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Features\n",
        "- JWT authentication\n",
        "- Token refreshing\n",
        "-Fresh token vs. Non-fresh token\n",
        "- Adding claims to JWT payload\n",
        "- Blacklist and token revoking\n",
        "- Customize JWT response/error message callbacks\n",
        "# JWT authentication\n",
        "Very much the same as before, but we define a UserLogin resource ourselves, as opposed to having a /auth endpoint created internally. And we no longer need the security.py file consequently.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Token Refreshing\n",
        "It allows the user login without having to entering the username and password over and over again. When logging in, we get an access token as before, and we also get a refresh token. We can use this refresh token to generate new access tokens without enter user credentials when the current access token expires.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Fresh token vs. Non-fresh token\n",
        "When generating an access token, we can pass in an optional boolean argument fresh. We usually want to distinguish if the token is generated via credentials or via refresh token. Since the one generated with credentials should be considered more secure. So what we did in the project is to return a fresh access token and a refresh token from the /login endpoint, since user would need to provide their credentials to authenticate through /login. As for the /refresh endpoint, it only requires a refresh token and no credentials, so it would return a non-fresh access token. The non-fresh access token still gives us some belief that it's the user himself, but it is not that secure. So it's okay to allow the user to access most endpoints using a non-fresh token, but we may want the user to input his credentials again (to get a fresh access token) when performing some more important actions, such as deleting things or payment.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Adding claims to JWT payload\n",
        "We can also add some extra data to each JWT payload, and these data are accessible within the endpoint. We refer to these data as claims. We can attach any claims we find necessary to the JWT payload. In this section, we showed one use case, where we check if the authenticated user is an admin, and added a boolean claim is_admin to the payload. Then in each JWT-protected endpoint, we can tell if the user is ad admin, and decide what actions should be taken from there.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Blacklist and token revoking\n",
        "We can blacklist a user or revoke a token (access token or refresh token) and disable the user from logging in and accessing a protected endpoint. Possible use cases for this feature include: if a user complains his account being compromised, or we decide to take down an existing account temporarily, we can blacklist the user and revoke the token thus prevent the user from logging in.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Customize JWT messages\n",
        "The default response/error handler may not have the nicest format of output. It uses clueless abbreviation such as iat for issue at time and msg for message. We can customize the callbacks and display the message we felt more readable.\n",

        "# Logging in with Flask-JWT-Extended\n",
        "We used the /login endpoint, defined in UserLogin resource. Focus on the similarities and differences from Flask-JWT authentication. Do not introduce refresh token and token freshness yet. Talk about JWT protected endpoint as well, since it's also similar with the previous Flask-JWT extension. Use the Item.get() endpoint as example.\n",

        "@jwt_required now as opposed to @jwt_required()\n",
        "# Adding claims to JWT payload\n",
        "Introduce the concept of claims, it's just the data we choose to attach to the JWT payload. Use the Item.delete() endpoint as example, we make it only accessible by authenticated admins. So we need to configure the claims in app.py and decide whether a user is an admin, then we add a boolean claim is_admin to the JWT payload.\n",

        "tips:\n",
        "\n",
        "- get_jwt_identity() now as opposed to current_identity\n",

        "# Half protected endpoints\n",
        "Introduce @jwt_optional decorator, which makes the endpoint accessible with and without an access token. Change the ItemList.get() endpoint to return different response depending on whether the caller is an authenticated user.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Token Refresh\n",
        "Introduce another endpoint, /refresh, for token refreshing. Add a refresh token in the previous /login endpoint response, and show how to get a new access token using the refresh token, without entering user credentials.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "- don't worry about token freshness for now (non-fresh by default)\n",
        "# Token freshness\n",
        "Talk about security concerns, and then introduce token freshness concept and the recommended way of using fresh/non-fresh access tokens. Then we return a fresh access token in the /login endpoint and return a non-fresh access token in the /refresh endpoint. Then introduce @fresh_jwt_required decorator for Item.post() endpoint, and show how non-fresh token would fail to call the endpoint compared to fresh access tokens.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Customize response/error callbacks\n",
